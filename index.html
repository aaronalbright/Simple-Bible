		<p>Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Working it up and down, back and forth. You're meant to have fun in life. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.</p>

		<p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. A happy cloud. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?</p>

		<p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. It's important to me that you're happy. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>

		<p>Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>
