#Notes

I'm not sure if having an index is helpful or not. The purpose of the index would be to have one place of all the verses, regardless of topic or location. Not sure what purpose that will be to the end user, but I know I'm going to want one for myself anyway so I might as well provide it to the user. Maybe just link to it in the footer?

*Also*
I'm using [Bob Ross Ipsum](http://bobrosslipsum.com), so I promise I didn't randomly write all that placeholder text.

I'm not sure if Bootstrap is the best thing to use for something like this the more complex my site gets, but for now I'm using to visually figure out where I want things. I'm confident in my ability to do everything through CSS, but bootstrap has made organization much easier.

The buttons are also just place holders, I'll probably make my own and then just use <img> tags in their place. Unless I can find a way to customize the buttons, in which case I don't see a difference. The goal is for the user to click each topic, then a drop-down window will appear with the content.

The more I read into bootstrap, even it's javascript capabilities, it seems like it'll suit my needs well. Though, I'm not sure if that would be "cheating" or not since I'm not inventing the javacsript on my own. 

###Basically,
Am I allowed to use Bootstrap? All of it? Some of it?
